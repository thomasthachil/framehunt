PROCESSING
(assume we have a video)
- split video into frames
- for each second, choose frame with least blur
- object detection -> switch from Clarifai -> build inhouse model (get good data set)
- set up search database with timestamp -> [object tags] (elastic search?)

INTERFACE
- explore other ways of jumping to frames and different UI elements for linking frames to tags.
